# Mongolia to Slovenia

Initial Reaction: I see. This may be my greatest challenge so far. This will test my power more than any trial I've faced before. 

China: Yesterday China was off limits, so it's good I'm glad I'll be able to use it today. 

[after clicking on China]: Why would I ever choose China! Russia is such an obviously better choice. It stretches *so* much farther West. 

Russia: this country is such a hack. Getting from central Asia to Eastern Europe in one move is so convenient. Thank god for the Kievan Rus. 

Ukraine: I'm not sure it would be a *great* idea to go from Russia to Ukraine in real life, but I guess it'll work here. 

Poland: While I'm here, I could visit my coworkers... 

Hungary: Is it Hungary or Romania that touches Ukraine? I think Romania is a little farther south. 

Complete: :)
